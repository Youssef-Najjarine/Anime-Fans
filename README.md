# ajax-project

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

I built this project so users interested in the world of Anime could test or improve their knowledge about Anime characters and TV shows. Not only did I want them to test their knowledge on the matter, but also be able to review shows that interested them as well.

For this particular project I decided to implement:
-Figma's wireframing tools to better plan for and organize the application before beginning the project.
-Applied *CSS3* media queries to achieve an application that is more responsive towards mobile users.
-Requesting data from a public API and implementing AJAX to display query results.
